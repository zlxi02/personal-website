# 元宵 2/12

When moon drifts towards the water edge  
Bone crested and scattered with rust  
Ridden of breath, dust, and snow

When star lays down with final sigh   
Rabbit shine dissolved from its veins  
Guiding towards the soft earth

When river's twilight falls past the trees  
Unfettered and unwinding  
Surrendering to the breeze

Then, will you,  
Voice of silkworm and sandstone  
of sepertine and leaf

let go?
